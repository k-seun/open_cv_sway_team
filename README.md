## Performing Feature matching between two images with OpenCV
This project provides an example of performing feature matching between two images using OpenCV and Python. Before the matching process, it visually displays the word "Star" around the matched feature points.
#### Packages Used and Versions:
  1. python (3.7.3)
  2. opencv (4.1.0)
  3. numpy (1.61.4)
#### How to run
  1. GitHub Repository Clone:
  
    git clone https://github.com/leetakdnxk/open_cv_sway_team.git
 2. Add Image Files:

    Add star.jpg and mixedimg.jpg image files to the project folder. The image files should be in a path that the code can read.

3. Run the Code in Python Environment:
   * Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
   * Execute the following command to run the code:

         python final.code.py
4. Check the Results:

   Once the code execution is complete, a window displaying the visual results of comparing and feature matching the two images will appear.
